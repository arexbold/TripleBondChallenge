# TripleBondChallenge
A very difficult challenge that focuses around using 3 Pokemon that are soul bound together in Pokemon HeartGold.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVEN'T LISTED EVERYTHING IN THIS CHALLENGE YET SO HONESTLY JUST WAIT UNTIL I MAKE AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT'S DONE. THE PATCHES ARE NOT PUBLIC YET SINCE I'M STILL MAKING TWEAKS SO PLEASE BE PATIENT.**

**Challenge by [Arex](https://twitch.tv/Arex)**

Special thanks to DS Hacking community members Kalaay and Yako for helping with changing hardcoded stuff for EXP and Fantafaust for help with HM QOL updates.

## **Core Rules**

### Party Rules
- You may only ever have **three Pokemon** in your party. (After I get the HM QOL patched)
- You can only catch one mon from each route via the 3 halls or fishing spot before the rival. You are not allowed to scout any mons. (Except for the Bug Catching Scout Reward)
- You must have your party of 3 before you fight the rival. No more, no less.
- No dupes of the same mon.
- Once you beat Falkner, you're locked in on your 3 Pokemon in your party.
- The only time you can replace a Pokemon is after you beat gym 4. See below.

### Pokemon Scouting
- As stated above, you are not allowed to scout any mons until the Bug Catching Contest. This is not to punish people but to make them improvise with what they've been given like an actual roguelike. I have modified how the Randomizer randomizes stats and even banned useless moves (see QOL changes at bottom) so that it's less likely to get completely useless mons. The strategy will come from picking your team of three. 
- Please see Bug Catching Scout Reward for info on actual allowed scouting.

### Pokemon Restrictions
- You cannot use any Pokemon with a BST of 600 or higher. Exception: If a Pokemon happens to evolve into a Pseudo Legendary mon of 600 BST that's fine.
- No legendaries.
- No dupes of the same Pokemon. Exception: If a Pokemon happens to evolve into the same mon as another party member it's fine. 

### Move/Ability restrictions
- Can only use Huge/Pure Power on mons with 420 BST and below. Exception: If you **never** use a physical move, you don't have a BST restriction.
- Can use healing moves but only once per battle. They've been modified to have less PP. You cannot use healing moves in wild battles.

### Banned Abilities
- Pickup is banned in a challenge like this so it will no longer randomize on Pokemon.

### Banned Moves
- Rest, Spore, and Pain Split.

### Setup Moves/Items restrictions
- You are allowed to use any 1 stage Setup Move twice per battle. Ex: Growl, Meditate, Harden
- You are allowed to use any 2 stage Setup Move once per battle. Ex: Swords Dance, Tail Glow, Iron Defense (Moves like Dragon Dance count as a 2 stage Setup Move.)
- You are allowed to use any Setup Items but only twice per battle.
- **If you use a Setup Item in battle, you are not allowed use Setup Moves in that same battle or vice versa**. 

### Bug Catching Scout Reward
- After you beat gym 4, you are now rewarded with a scouted mon! Congratulations on getting here. Now that you know what your team lacks, it's time to search for the missing piece to your trio!
- You are allowed to catch any mon that is the same level or lower than your highest mon.
- You are only allowed to catch 3 Pokemon to look at and decide on **only one** that you'll use. If you don't like any of them that's fine. You can choose to keep your original three but you **cannot** use the Move Relearner since you've scouted.
- If one of your Pokemon happens to die from scouting, you are no longer allowed to catch the mon that killed your mon. You do not reset. 
- You are allowed to use the Move Relearner NPC at the Bug Catching Contest on your **confirmed picked mon** and only **after you release the mon you're giving up from your original three**.
- If you are not going to scout for any Pokemon and are satisfied with your team of three, you are allowed to use the Move Relearner NPC on any one of your original three. **Only if you choose to not scout**.

### Permadeath
- If **any one** of your 3 mons faints at any time, their bond is broken and you must reset.  

### EXP & Progression
- EXP is **evenly distributed** among all three Pokemon (via patch).
- **No wild Pokemon EXP**.
- All EXP comes from **trainer battles only**.

### Battle Rules
- **Set battle style**
- **No items in battle.** (Held items are allowed except broken items like Leftovers, Focus Band, etc.)
- **No healing outside of battle.**
- Pokemon Center usage is fine of course.

### Trainer & Game Rules
- Trainer Pokemon levels are increased by 30% (still trying to find the balance for the lower level Pokemon for the player)  
- No shops except for Repels and Poke Balls.
- Once you enter a Gym, Elite Four, or dungeon, you may not leave until it is cleared.
- You are allowed to go back into a Dungeon if you have cleared it.
- Moves, abilities, evolutions (same typing), stats, etc are all randomized.
- Forced evos for enemy mons at level 30.
- More specific rules will come to clarify more information.

### TMs/HMs usage
- TMs found in the field are not allowed to be used. You're only allowed to use TMs that you receive from Gym Leaders.
- HMs are now randomized into Pokemon movesets. You are only allowed to use HM moves if it was randomized into your Pokemon's moveset. **You cannot teach your Pokemon an HM Move with an HM**

### Held Item restrictions
- You are allowed to use any held item except for the following: Leftovers, Focus Band, Focus Sash

### QOL Updates and Features
- Smarter randomization for stats so that mons are less likely to be completely useless. 
- Removed 19 moves from the randomized move pool. (Splash, Imprison, Teleport, Spider Web, Spikes, False Swipe, Mean Look, Sweet Scent, Spit Up, Swallow, Recycle, Block, Natural Gift, Feint, Fling, Toxic Spikes, Stealth Rock, Lunar Dance, Snatch) **This will be modified soon remove/add some moves**
- Removed the same 19 moves from the TM randomization pool.
- Removed Pick Up from the randomized ability pool. (No need to have this if you're not allowed to take items from Pick Up)
- Added HMs to the randomized move pool.
- 30 Nest Balls, Old Rod, and Smokeball given at the beginning.
- You can now catch up to 4 mons (from 11 mons available) before the rival. This includes a fishing spot in New Bark.
- The first 3 grasses now have only level 5s.
- Equalized the wild grass rates to be even between all mons. (It's not perfect unfortunately)
- You are unable to use the lab for healing but will get healed right before you start the Rival battle.
- Changed the intro so that everything is done as soon you leave the lab. No more walking for 2 mins. The 1st 3 routes with Pokemon are all connected to each other by rooms. Starting up a run is quick.
- No longer need an HM friend **COMING SOON**
- Some moves have been modified to fit the challenge. Mainly the healing moves.
- Move Releaner NPC at the Bug Catching Contest

## Victory Conditions
- **Win:** Defeat Red in Mt Silver.
- **Lose:** If **any one** of your 3 dies, reset.

### Comments
The greatest thing about this challenge is that it will open up the door to SO MANY more strategies to work with including being able to use moves like U-Turn, use a Tank Mon, and potentially even use a Shedinja(?!) in your party. I would love to see people explore 2 damage dealers and 1 tank for team synergy. Hope you enjoy the challenge!

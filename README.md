# TripleBondChallenge
A very difficult challenge that focuses around using 3 Pokemon that are soul bound together.

**PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVEN'T LISTED EVERYTHING IN THIS CHALLENGE YET SO HONESTLY JUST WAIT UNTIL I MAKE AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT'S DONE. I JUST RUSHED TO GET THIS STUFF UP LOL**

The greatest thing about this challenge is that it will open up the door to SO MANY more strategies to work with including being able to use moves like U-Turn or even use mons like Shedenja when you normally couldn't use in single mon challenges. 

## Core Rules

### Party Rules
- You may only ever have **three Pokemon** in your party. (After I get the HM QOL patched)
- You can only catch one mon from each route via the 3 halls or fishing spot before the rival.
- You must have your party of 3 before you fight the rival. 
- After you beat gym 4, you're allowed to swap out 1 Pokemon from the Bug Catching contest.

### Permadeath
- If **any one** of your 3 mons faints at any time, their bond is broken and you must reset.  

### EXP & Progression
- EXP is **evenly distributed** among all three Pokemon (via patch).
- **No wild Pokemon EXP**.
- All EXP comes from **trainer battles only**.

### Battle Rules
- **Set battle style**
- **No items in battle.** (Held items are allowed except broken items like Leftovers, Focus Band, etc.)
- **No healing outside of battle.**  

### Trainer & Game Rules
- Trainer Pokemon levels are increased by 30% (still trying to find the balance for the lower level Pokemon for the player)  
- No shops except for Repels and Poke Balls.
- Once you enter a Gym, Elite Four, or dungeon, you may not leave until it is cleared.  
- Moves, abilities, evolutions (same typing), stats, etc are all randomized.
- Forced evos for enemy mons at level 30.
- More rules will come.
- No legendary or psuedo legendary pokemon. Basically nothing higher than 599 BST.

### QOL Updates and Features
- New scouting zone before rival
- Expedited starter area
- Balls in the beginning
- AND MORE SORRY ILL UPDATE AGAIN LATER LOL

---

## Victory Conditions
- **Win:** Defeat Red in the Kanto Region. 
- **Lose:** If **any one** of your 3 dies, reset.

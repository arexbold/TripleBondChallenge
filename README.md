# TripleBondChallenge
A very difficult challenge that brings a roguelike experience in Pokemon HeartGold with a focus of using 3 Pokemon as a squad. 

**CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH CLEANUP AND CHANGES FOR RELEASE PREP. THESE RULES ARE NOW INCORRECT, MISSING THINGS, AND A LITTLE MESSY FOR CURRENT PRE-RELEASE RUNNERS. SORRY.**

**CURRENTLY IN PRE-RELEASE. NO RUNS ARE LEGITIMATE DUE TO POTENTIAL BUGS AND UNFINISHED RULES.** 

Please join Discord for bugs/feedback: [https://discord.gg/mg3G3VqVbf](https://discord.gg/mg3G3VqVbf) We're gonna need it! haha

PyroMike for the initial Intro Patch this was built on. All the wonderful people from Kingdom of DS Hacking. OnlySpaghettiCode, UTDZac, and Mixone for helping make the NDS tracker compatible with the challenge.

## **Core Rules**

### Party Rules
- You may only ever have **three Pokemon** in your party if you're going to battle.
- Once you beat Falkner, you're locked in on your 3 Pokemon in your party.
- The only time you can replace a Pokemon is after you beat gym 4. See Bug Catching Scout Reward.

### Battle Rules
- **No healing outside of battle** except for using the Pokemon Center.

### Permadeath
- If **any one** of your 3 mons faints at any time, their bond is broken and you must reset by starting a new seed.

### Victory Conditions
- **Win:** Defeat Red(???) in Mt Silver. This fight happens immediately after you beat the Champ at the Elite Four. **NO YOU DON'T GO TO KANTO**
- **Lose:** If **any one** of your 3 dies, reset.

### Start of Run
- **Make sure you make a save file right before you pick your starter ball. This only needs to be done once every time you patch the game with a new update.**
- Choose a ball direction before you look at the starter Pokemon. You must pick that one.
- You can only catch one mon from each route via the 3 halls or starting town.
- You are not allowed to fight these mons to see their moves. You can only catch. (Move scouting is part of a mid-run reward. See Bug Catching Contest.)
- There's a hidden item on the lightpost after you beat the rival.
- After you beat the Rival, you can catch one mon from Route 31, Dark Cave, Ruins of Alph, and Route 32. These are to help you further fine tune your team.
  - Remember: You can only take 3 to battle. I recommend catching everything and then forming a team before fighting the other trainers before Sprout Tower.

### Extra Catching Rules
- You are not allowed to use Headbutt to get more mons.
- If you catch a mon with a banned ability, you're free to catch the same mon again if it has a second ability.
  - You can decide to catch a different mon on that route if it only has a banned ability.

### Important features you need to know:
- Press Select to cycle the tracker view between your Pokemon in party.
  - This helps with making quick decisions in battle for switching.
  - It also helps if multiple mons learn moves in battle so you can see their stats.
- Press R to Fast Travel to anywhere you've been. Please only use after you beat the first rival fight.

### Early Run Rewards
- You're allowed to use the TM 70 and catch 1 of the 2 Pokemon from the Sprout Tower after you beat it. Last chance for a new Pokemon.
- After you beat Falkner, you are rewarded with EV training items. You are now allowed to use these if you want to *fix* your Pokemon's stats.
- The NPC that will take shards for berries is in Violet Town so don't forget to use him. 

### EXP & Progression
- EXP is **evenly distributed** among all three Pokemon (via patch).
  - It doesn't matter if they participated in the battle or not.
- **No wild Pokemon EXP**.
- All EXP comes from **trainer battles only**.

### Pokemon Restrictions
- No dupes of the same Pokemon.
  - Exception: If a Pokemon happens to evolve into the same mon as another party member it's fine.

### Move Restrictions
- Can use healing moves but only once per battle if outside of a dungeon/gym.
  - If you're in a dungeon/gym you can only use it once for that whole dungeon/gym.
  - This rule applies to each mon on your team.

### Banned Moves
- Aqua Ring, Leech Seed, Rest, Spore, and Pain Split.
  - They're not taken out of the randomization so that the enemy can still use them.

### Setup Moves/Items restrictions
- Any pure setup move (that does not deal damage) can only be used once per Pokemon per battle.
- Additionally, you cannot use Battle Items on a Pokemon that used a setup move, or the reverse order.

### Held Item restrictions
- None

### TMs/HMs usage
- HMs are now randomized into Pokemon movesets. You are only allowed to use HM moves if it was randomized into your Pokemon's moveset. **You cannot teach your Pokemon an HM Move with an HM**
- TMs will not disappear after use due to a bug. You cannot keep using that TM. Please keep track.

### Bug Catching Scout Reward
- After you beat Gym 4, you are allowed to catch a new mon from the Bug Catching Contest to replace one of your Pokemon.
- You are only allowed to catch 3 Pokemon to look at and decide on **only one** that you'll use. If you don't like any of them that's fine. You can choose to keep your original three.
- If one of your Pokemon happens to die from scouting, you are no longer allowed to catch the mon that killed your mon. You do not reset.
- You are allowed to use the Spite Move Tutor at the Bug Catching Contest if you choose.
- You are allowed to use the Move Relearner NPC at the Bug Catching Contest only after you beat Morty.
  - You are not allowed to relearn Sketch Orin.

### Trainer & Game Rules
- No shopping except for evo items from GoldenRod City.
- Once you enter a Gym, Elite Four, or dungeon, you may not leave until it is cleared.
  - You are allowed to go back into a Dungeon if you have cleared it but you are not allowed to fight any trainers you left behind UNLESS they were inaccessible when you first cleared the dungeon.
- You must beat all trainers in a gym before fighting the Gym Leader.

### Lake Rage Shiny
- You may catch this to use if you like but you must give up one of your mons immediately after you catch it. If you don't like it too bad.
- No Orin, you can't catch a legendary/pseudo.

## Not rules but information for the people that are curious
- The game is set to Switch mode BUT you cannot see what the enemy will use. This is on purpose by design for the challenge.
- Moves, abilities, evolutions (same typing), stats, etc are all randomized.
- Trainer Pokemon levels are increased by 30%.
- Forced evos for enemy mons at level 30.
- Gym leaders, bosses, and Elite Four trainers have held items.

### QOL Updates and Features
- Tracker changes so that you can cycle through your party of mons really easily with pressing Select.
- Removed moves and abilities to better adjust for challenge.
- Added HMs to the randomized move pool.
- Static encounters instead of wild encounters for ease of use.
- You can now catch up to 4 mons (from 11 mons available) before the rival.
- You are unable to use the lab for healing but will get healed right before you start the Rival battle.
- Changed the intro so that everything is done as soon you leave the lab. No more walking for 2 mins. The 1st 3 routes with Pokemon are all connected to each other by rooms. Starting up a run is quick.
- No longer need an HM friend.
- Fast Travel (Fly) with pressing the R button. This is unlocked from the beginning of the game but don't start using until you beat the rival.
- Some moves have been modified to fit the challenge. Mainly weak moves have been buffed, drain moves changed, and other changes.
- Move Releaner NPC at the Bug Catching Contest
- Move Tutor for Spite at the Bug Catching Contest
- You will ALWAYS run away from battle. No longer need Smoke Ball.

### Favorites
- There's no need to do Favorites like seen in other challenges but feel free to do it if you want.

### Documenation
- I'll eventually get to this sorry.

Please note: **If there's ever an update of the rom patch that requires you to update the randomizer/tracker it will say so with an additional text file named with UPDATE YOUR RANDOMIZER/TRACKER**

### How to patch your game for Triple Bond Challenge
Download the [patch](https://github.com/arexbold/TripleBondChallenge/releases) and apply it to a vanilla USA HeartGold rom with the Rom Patcher: [https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/](https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/)

### Required Emulator
Please use Bizhawk for this challenge: [https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/releases/tag/2.10](https://github.com/TASEmulators/BizHawk/releases/tag/2.10)

Version 2.11 JUST came out and this challenge patch and the tracker have not been tested with it yet so v 2.10 is linked above.

### Helpful map
If you don't have HeartGold memorized then it's required you use this map otherwise you will miss so much. The only thing that's wrong are the levels on the trainers. Everything else is accurate.

### Permadeath
- If **any one** of your 3 mons faints at any time, their bond is broken and you must reset by starting a new seed.

### Start of Run
- **Make sure you make a save file right before you pick your starter ball. This only needs to be done once every time you patch the game with a new update.**
- Choose a direction before you look at your starter. That is your starter. See Pokemon Restrictions for mons you're not allowed to use.
  - If your starter is a banned, you're free to choose between the others.
- You can only catch one mon from each route via the 3 halls or fishing spot before the rival.
- You are not allowed to fight these mons to see their moves. You can only catch. (Move scouting is part of a mid-run reward. See Bug Catching Contest.)
